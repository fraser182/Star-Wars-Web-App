# Group Project: Star Wars Fan Site

A Full-Stack RESTful App for a Star Wars Fan Site, called Star Wars World.

## Brief

To create a Star Wars Fan Site which hosts a plentiful amount of information for users to enhance their knowledge of the Star Wars franchise, with the option to take some fun quizzes. We used the Staw Wars API Swapi (https://swapi.co/) for this information.
We imagined the age of the user on the site being from late primary school upwards.

* Add a shop to sell merchandise
* Look into adding other functionality to keep a user entertained 


## MVP

## What I Have Learned and Enjoyed
From this CodeClan Group Project
* Being SCRUM master and having the resposiblity to look after people.
* Implementing the AGILE methodology using Kanban (and Trello) - it was a good way to consistently reflect our work as a group at the end of each sprint and kept us on task.
* It was a good challenge to import the data from all the seperate pages from the Swapi (https://swapi.co/) API, in the most efficient way with our level of skillset currently. I had already tried this from a previous homework, so can confirm that this solution worked better. 
* Designing the divs to hold the information about each planet, character, etc, in Star Wars was a good test as my vision initially didn't meet my design, so I worked hard to get that to marry.
